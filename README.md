it is basically a banking system and when you run it console is asking for a password and pthe password is "csi218"
and by entering the password you can see all the available menus 
and apart form this i built an interesting thing, it shows the amount in written form
suppose you have "1050" taka in your balance it shows you "one thousand fifty taka"
